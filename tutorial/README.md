# Tutorial

To get started with WidgetBot, first you must invite the bot to your server.

After you add the bot to your server, you need to pick a format to use in your website.  
You can choose between Crate and one of our inline formats.

## Formats

* **[Crate (recommended)](/embed/crate/tutorial.md)**: Shows a little chat button in the corner of your website. It shows message notifications and provides an API. [Tutorial](/embed/crate/tutorial.md), [Documentation](/embed/crate/README.md)

### Inline formats
These let you put a chat box in your site you can change the size, etc.

* **[html-embed](/embed/html-embed/tutorial.md)**: A lightweight iframe wrapper which provides access to the [embed-api](/embed/embed-api/README.md). Requires JavaScript. [Tutorial](/embed/html-embed/tutorial.md), [Documentation](/embed/html-embed/README.md)
* **[react-embed](/embed/react-embed/README.md)**: Provides access to the embed as a React component, and lets you use the [embed-api](/embed/embed-api/README.md). [Documentation](/embed/react-embed/README.md)
* **[iframe](iframes.md)**: Use this when you can't use JavaScript. It does not provide access to the [embed-api](/embed/embed-api/README.md), and may break the browser back button. [Tutorial](iframes.md)
