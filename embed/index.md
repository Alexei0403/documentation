::: tip Getting started

WidgetBot provides rich client-side wrappers around the widgets. Each wrapper provides access to the [embed-api](/embed/embed-api/), allowing your website to programatically:

- Listen for message events
- Track and manage the logged-in user
- Navigate to a different channel

*and more*
