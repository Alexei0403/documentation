# Tutorial

To get started with WidgetBot, first you must invite the bot to your server.

::: tip Need help?
If you need any assistance adding WidgetBot, please ask in [the server](https://discord.gg/NYBEhN7). **However**, please make sure you mention **what the issue is**, **send your code** in a codeblock (` ``` `), include **your server id and cluster**, and optionally include **a link to your site**.

## Adding the Bot

**[Add the official bot](https://add.widgetbot.io)**

::: tip Important
WidgetBot will not work if you don't add the bot to your server!

After you add one of the bots to your server, you need to pick a format to use in your website.  
You can choose between Crate and one of our inline formats.

## Formats

* **[Crate (recommended)](/embed/crate/tutorial)**: Shows a little chat button in the corner of your website. It shows message notifications and provides an API. [Info](https://widgetbot.io/crate), [Tutorial](/embed/crate/tutorial), [Documentation](/embed/crate)

### Inline formats
These let you put a chat box in your site you can change the size, etc.

* **[html-embed](/embed/html-embed/tutorial)**: A lightweight iframe wrapper which provides access to the [embed-api](https://github.com/widgetbot-io/embed-api). Requires JavaScript. [Tutorial](/embed/html-embed/tutorial), [Documentation](/embed/html-embed)
* **[react-embed](/embed/react-embed)**: Provides access to the embed as a React component, and lets you use the [embed-api](https://github.com/widgetbot-io/embed-api). [Documentation](/embed/react-embed)
* **[iframe](iframes)**: Use this when you can't use JavaScript. It does not provide access to the [embed-api](https://github.com/widgetbot-io/embed-api), and may break the browser back button. [Tutorial](iframes)
